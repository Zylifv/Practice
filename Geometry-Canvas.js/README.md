This is going to be my first project working with canvas and 2D shapes.
I have no experience whatsoever with this side of JS so I expect to learn a lot.
The project will take many forms as I work through how canvas and plotting shapes work.
I expect to make many mistakes as well as write some sloppy code but thats how we all start, right?
