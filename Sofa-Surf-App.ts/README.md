Sofa-Surf-App - work in progress (typescript learning app)

![sofa-surfing-app-example](sofa-surfingPNG.png)

I wanted to work on a small webpage project that utilised the features of Typescript heavily and Scrimba gave me the tools to do so.
I am going to be updating this project frequently until i am happy with the final result.
