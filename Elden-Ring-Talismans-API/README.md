This was a fun project to see how much I could remember about API calls and also to keep my CSS and HTML skills somewhat fresh after spending weeks learning the C# language.
I wanted to make something that could scale up and eventually I would like to add a nav-bar to look for Weapons/Skills/Spells etc not just Talismans. This is just the start for me.
To see a working version of this small project, please us my CodePen link below:
