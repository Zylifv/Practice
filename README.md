This is going to be a repository for all of the different coding challenges/tasks/practice i will do to help me sharpen my skills as a coder.

The 'Practice' folder will contain any and all examples of modules/tests/labs i think will help my problem solving skills.
I intend to look back on where i have improved and what skills i have learnt from the start of my journey.
My main goal is to show that i have improved not only the speed on my soluions to problems but also the readability and maintainabiltiy of my code.

This repository will contain mostly Javascript, Typescript and C# code and those are the languages i am learning currently, but the folder will also contain small amounts of HTML and CSS for presentation purposes on larger projects.
