I wanted to try and create my own version of Yahtzee which was inspired from Balatro.
I like the abilities presented in that game so that the player can munipulate outcomes with variance.
I want to first make a Yahtzee game that plays normally, then introduce ways the player can alter dice-rolls, use abilties, gain dice etc

Things to do:
 - Resolve the scoring system effectively (user chooses which way to score & go to next round when applicable)
 - Minimise repeat code (remove all un-necessary code eventually)
 - Have a way to track which options the player has already used when choosing how to score
 - Maybe have a score the player must try to beat? (Single player progeression system)
 - Eventually add different ways the player can change outcomes with card effects, such as:
        > Adding an extra dice for one roll
        > Having dice only roll odd or even for one roll
        > Guaranteeing a dice rolls how you want (choose the number)
        > One less dice in a round gives currency? (Add option for currency like other games)
        > Betting on a certain score category awards a way to upgrade the score for that outcome? (Betting on a full-house, then rolling one upgrades its score by 0.1% etc.)

For a working example of the game (during its progress), please use the link below:
